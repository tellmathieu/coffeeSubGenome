MissingOutputException in rule downloadFlo in file /data/data2/homes/tmathieu/testingCofSM/1snake.smk, line 95:
Job 6  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 20 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/data/data2/homes/tmathieu/testingCofSM/flo/Rakefile
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
